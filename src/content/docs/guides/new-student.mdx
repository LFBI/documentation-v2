Welcome to LFBI! We are so excited for you to begin studying God's Word with us. Please read the guide below to log in to your student account and enroll in the school.

## Log in to your account

### Understanding your LFBI student account

LFBI provides every student with a **Microsoft 365** account. This offers many perks for you as a student, for free!

-   Your LFBI account has access to online versions of the **Microsoft Office** suite of applications, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote, at the [Microsoft 365](https://www.office.com/login) portal.
-   Your LFBI account is an **email address** which you can open at your [Outlook](https://outlook.office.com/mail/inbox) inbox.
-   Your LFBI account has **online cloud storage** with [OneDrive](https://www.onedrive.live.com). This is a great place to store your class notes and assignments.
-   Your LFBI account is used to log in to our [MyLFBI](https://mylfbi.org/login/index.php) learning platform. All you have to do is click the **365 Connect** button to Single-Sign-On (SSO) into MyLFBI using your Microsoft account.

At LFBI, your login is shared between MyLFBI and the Microsoft 365 services listed above. This means that when you are logged in to Microsoft 365, you can easily log in to MyLFBI. However, if you are not logged in to Microsoft 365, you cannot log in to MyLFBI.

You must log in to Microsoft 365 *first* in order to be granted access to MyLFBI, our school website.

### Sign in to Microsoft 365

1.  Go to https://www.office.com.
2.  Click **Sign in** on either the top-right or the center of the page to begin the login process.
3.  Enter your username and then your temporary password from your Welcome email.
4.  Create your own password.
5.  When prompted, you should also provide a recovery phone number and email address.

### Sign in to MyLFBI

Now that you have signed in to Microsoft 365, you will be able to use **365 Connect** to sign in at MyLFBI.

1.  Go to https://www.mylfbi.org.
2.  Click **Log in** on the top-right of the page.
3.  Click **365 Connect (Current Student)** to complete the Single-Sign-On process.

:::caution

On the MyLFBI Login page, *do not enter your username and password again.* By signing in to Office first, you are able to use the **365 Connect (Current Student)** button to log in via Microsoft Office. (The manual username & password entry is a legacy feature used primarily by teachers, staff, and other non-student accounts.) If you attempt to use your LFBI.org credentials on the MyLFBI login form, you will get an *"Invalid login, please try again"* error.

## Enroll

### Understanding the Program of Study

At LFBI, the Program of Study is broken down into three phases:
1.  Foundations
2.  Bible Essentials
3.  Leadership Prep

The three phases of the Program of study are in order. The **Foundations** set of courses are a *required* prerequisite before proceeding to the rest of the Program.

#### Freshman Orientation

This is an 8-week course introducing students to LFBI, how it functions as an institution, and how to succeed academically. 

:::note
    It is highly recommended that you take Freshman Orientation during your first semester as a student at LFBI.
:::


#### Foundations 1

This is a 16-week course which is required only for students who have *not* completed Biblical Discipleship within their local church. If you have already been discipled in your local church, you can skip this course!

#### Foundations 2 / Foundations 3

This pair of 16-week courses (sometimes known as *Discipleship 2*) are the final step of the Foundations track. They cover:
-   The Character Qualities of a Man or Woman of God
-   The Spiritual Qualities of a Man or Woman of God
-   The Seven Stages of Spiritual Growth
-   The Philosophy of Biblical Discipleship
-   How to Disciple
-   How to Study the Bible & Apparent Contradictions

If you completed Discipleship 2 or a similar training in your local church, you can receive transfer credit by coordinating with your church to submit a syllabus and grade to LFBI. For more information, please contact the Registrar at [registrar@lfbi.org](mailto:registrar@lfbi.org).

### Browse the course offerings on LFBI.org

Our course offerings are listed on the LFBI website at https://www.lfbi.org. In the navigation bar, there is a page for each upcoming semester under the Academics heading. You can browse these course lists to see what is being offered. To view the details for a course, click its icon. When you are ready to enroll in that course, click  **Enroll**.

After you click **Enroll**, you will be taken to the Enrollment page for that course. 
-   The first option on the page is to enroll as a **STUDENT**.
    -   The cost for enrollment as a Student is $40 per Credit Hour.
-   The second option on the page (which may not be available for some courses) is to enroll as an **AUDITOR**.
    -   An AUDIT enrollment grants you access to the Course's lectures and notes, but you will NOT be granted access to the Course's assessments or receive a grade.
    -   The cost for enrollment as an Auditor is $20 per Credit Hour.
