## Understanding the Program of Study

At LFBI, the Program of Study is broken down into three phases:
1.  Foundations
2.  Bible Essentials
3.  Leadership Prep

The three phases of the Program of study are in order. The **Foundations** set of courses are a *required* prerequisite before proceeding to the rest of the Program.

### Freshman Orientation

This is an 8-week course introducing students to LFBI, how it functions as an institution, and how to succeed academically. 

:::note

It is highly recommended that you take Freshman Orientation during your first semester as a student at LFBI.

:::


### Foundations 1

This is a 16-week course which is required only for students who have *not* completed Biblical Discipleship within their local church. If you have already been discipled in your local church, you can skip this course!

### Foundations 2 / Foundations 3

This pair of 16-week courses (sometimes known as *Discipleship 2*) are the final step of the Foundations track. They cover:
-   The Character Qualities of a Man or Woman of God
-   The Spiritual Qualities of a Man or Woman of God
-   The Seven Stages of Spiritual Growth
-   The Philosophy of Biblical Discipleship
-   How to Disciple
-   How to Study the Bible & Apparent Contradictions

If you completed Discipleship 2 or a similar training in your local church, you can receive transfer credit by coordinating with your church to submit a syllabus and grade to LFBI. For more information, please contact the Registrar at [registrar@lfbi.org](mailto:registrar@lfbi.org).
