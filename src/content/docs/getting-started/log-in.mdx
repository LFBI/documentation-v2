## Understanding your LFBI student account

LFBI provides every student with a **Microsoft 365** account. This offers many perks for you as a student, for free!

-   Your LFBI account has access to online versions of the **Microsoft Office** suite of applications, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote, at the [Microsoft 365](https://www.office.com/login) portal.
-   Your LFBI account is an **email address** which you can open at your [Outlook](https://outlook.office.com/mail/inbox) inbox.
-   Your LFBI account has **online cloud storage** with [OneDrive](https://www.onedrive.live.com). This is a great place to store your class notes and assignments.
-   Your LFBI account is used to log in to our [MyLFBI](https://mylfbi.org/login/index.php) learning platform. All you have to do is click the **365 Connect** button to Single-Sign-On (SSO) into MyLFBI using your Microsoft account.

At LFBI, your login is shared between MyLFBI and the Microsoft 365 services listed above. This means that when you are logged in to Microsoft 365, you can easily log in to MyLFBI. However, if you are not logged in to Microsoft 365, you cannot log in to MyLFBI.

You must log in to Microsoft 365 *first* in order to be granted access to MyLFBI, our school website.

:::caution

On the MyLFBI Login page, *do not enter your username and password again.* By signing in to Office first, you are able to use the **365 Connect (Current Student)** button to log in via Microsoft Office. (The manual username & password entry is a legacy feature used primarily by teachers, staff, and other non-student accounts.) If you attempt to use your LFBI.org credentials on the MyLFBI login form, you will get an *"Invalid login, please try again"* error.
