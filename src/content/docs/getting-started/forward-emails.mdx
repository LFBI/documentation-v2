## Understanding the importance of email forwarding

Every LFBI student is provided with a Microsoft Account. That account is also an email address which you can access on [Outlook](https://www.outlook.com).

By default, communications from your courses as well as announcements from the school are sent to this address.

_If you do not forward these emails to your personal inbox, you may miss out on important information!_
