## Understanding the importance of email forwarding

Every LFBI student is provided with a Microsoft Account. That account is also an email address which you can access on [Outlook](https://www.outlook.com).

By default, communications from your courses as well as announcements from the school are sent to this address.

_If you do not forward these emails to your personal inbox, you may miss out on important information!_

## Forward your emails

<Steps>

1.  Go to [Outlook](https://www.outlook.com) and sign in with your LFBI.org account.
2.  Click the *Settings* gear icon on the top-right of the page.
4.  In the _Search settings_ field on top left of the pop-up window, type in "Forwarding" and click **Forwarding** from the results.
5.  Turn on the toggle for **Enable forwarding** and then enter your personal email address.
6.  Click **Save** to apply the forwarding rule.
